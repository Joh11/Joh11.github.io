* <<<Bernal stacking>>>
Same as AB stacking.
  
* <<<Burgers vector>>>
Vector used to characterize a dislocation. Can be computed by defining
a rectangle before dislocation, and dislocating ; the Burgers vector
is defined as the vector needed to "close" the dislocated rectangle
again.

* <<<Creation and annihilation operators for the QHO>>>
\begin{equation*}
  \hat a = \sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}} \left(
   \hat x +
   \frac{i}{m \omega} \hat p
  \right)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  \hat a^\dagger = \sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}} \left(
   \hat x -
   \frac{i}{m \omega} \hat p
  \right)
\end{equation*}

See Quantum harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian for how the Hamiltonian is
expressed with respect to these operators.

* <<<Chalcogen>>>
The chalcogens are the elements of the group (column) 16 of the
periodic table. There are elements behaving similar to oxygen: oxygen,
sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium.

* <<<DFT band structure>>>
To be really clear: the band structure, as computed within DFT by VASP
or Quantum Espresso, is not the /real/ band structure. It is the
spectrum of the solution to the Kohn-Sham equations, so it is not the
proper quasiparticle band structure.

* <<<DFT+U>>> calculations
An extension of the DFT method with a Hubbard term. Used when DFT is
not sufficient for transition metals (d and f orbitals).

* <<<DFT-Koopmans theorem>>>
Really similar to the Koopmans theorem, which works for the
Hartree-Fock approximation. It states the ionization energy is minus
the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue of the highest occupied energy band.

* <<<Edwards-Wilkinson equation>>>
Arises in the context of growing surfaces.

\begin{equation*}
\pdiff{h}{t} = \nu_0 + \nu \nabla^2 h + \eta
\end{equation*}

where \(h(\vec x, t)\) is the height of the surface at the position
\(\vec x\), \(\nu_0\) is a constant growth term, \(\nu\) is a
diffusion factor, and \(\eta\) is a random noise.

For simplicity, \(\eta(\vec x, t)\) is usually taken as a white noise, that is:
\begin{equation*}
\langle\eta\rangle = 0
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\langle\eta(t)\eta(t')\rangle = D \delta(t-t')
\end{equation*}
  
* <<<Electronic temperature>>>
See smearing. 

* <<<Exciton>>>
A quasiparticle, a bound state of an electron and a hole in a
material, kept together by the Coulomb force. This is of course a
neutral quasiparticle.
  
* <<<Gaussian integral>>>
\begin{equation*}
  \int \dd x e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}} =
  \sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
  \int \dd x x^2 e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}} =
  \sigma^3 \sqrt{2\pi}
\end{equation*}

* <<<Gaussian smearing>>>
See smearing for more general information.

Many quantities can be computed as a sum over all occupied
states. Then, the \(k\)-resolved density of state can be written as:
\begin{equation*}
  \text{DOS}(\vec k, \varepsilon) = \sum_{n, \varepsilon_{n\vec k} < E_F}
  \delta(\varepsilon - \varepsilon_{n\vec k})
\end{equation*}

The gaussian smearing technique consists in broadening the delta
function to a gaussian:
\begin{equation*}
  \delta(\varepsilon - \varepsilon_{n\vec k}) \longrightarrow
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(\varepsilon - \varepsilon_{n\vec k})^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\end{equation*}

The parameter \(\sigma\) corresponds to the =degauss= value in Quantum
Espresso.

* <<<Hellman-Feynman theorem>>>
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\dd E_\lambda}{\dd \lambda} = \left\langle \psi_\lambda \left|
  \frac{\dd \hat H_\lambda}{\dd \lambda}
  \right| \psi_\lambda \right\rangle
\end{equation*}

If \(|\psi_\lambda\rangle\) is an eigenstate of \(\hat H_\lambda\),
i.e. \(\hat H_\lambda |\psi_\lambda \rangle = E_\lambda|\psi_\lambda
\rangle\).

* <<<Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation>>>
A nonlinear extension of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation. In order to
take into account the fact that a tilted surface has more surface
area, hence would grow faster, a nonlinear term \(\left(\nabla
h\right)^2\).

\begin{equation*}
  \pdiff{h}{t} = \nu_0 + \nu \nabla^2 h
  + \frac{\lambda}{2} \left(\nabla h \right)^2+ \eta
\end{equation*}

\(\lambda\) is a tunable parameter, set to 1 if the KPZ equation is
derived from a tilted surface (then it is the first term in the
expansion of a square root).
  
* <<<Monkhorst-Pack>>> \(k\) grid
Grid to cover the Brillouin zone, different from the simplest grid
(\(\Gamma\) centered):
\begin{equation*}
  \vec{k_n} = \frac{n + \frac{1 - N}{2}}{N} \vec b
  \text{, for }n = 0, ..., N - 1
\end{equation*}

To note: for odd \(N\), it contains the \(\Gamma\) point, but not for
even \(N\).

According to VASP Wiki, calculations usually converge faster on
Monkhorst-Pack grids than on \(\Gamma\) centered grid, however special
care has to be given to make sure no symmetry is broken.

* <<<Pulay forces>>>
Non physical forces that emerge in the context of a self consistent
field calculation (e.g. DFT or HF). To compute the derivative of the
energy with respect to the atomic positions, the Hellman-Feynman
theorem is used. However it only holds for a complete basis set. All
basis sets are in reality not complete, usually with an energy
cutoff. This means that the theorem is not exactly correct, giving
birth to extra terms, that is, extra forces.

These have the tendency to underestimate the equilibrium volume
(because more forces).

Their effect is reduced with a greater energy cutoff (hence a "more
complete" basis set).
  
* <<<Quantum harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian>>>
\begin{equation*}
  \hat H = \frac{\hat p^2}{2m} + \frac12 m \omega^2 \hat x^2
  = \hbar \omega \left( \hat a^\dagger \hat a + \frac12 \right)
\end{equation*}

* <<<Smearing>>> in DFT calculations
Trick used to improve convergence for SCF calculations in metals and
semimetals. At zero temperature, the occupation number is a sharp
function of the energy (jumps from 1 or 2 to 0 above the Fermi
level). Thus, it can be difficult to integrate properly. Smearing
helps with that, smoothing out the occupation number, as if there was
a nonzero temperature.

In practise, the Fermi-Dirac is not used, but simpler approximations,
like the gaussian method of smearing. A refinement called cold
smearing, or Marzari-Vanderbilt smearing can be used.

How to choose the smearing parameters ? A convergence test may be
useful, but one can first simply use a gaussian smearing with
=degauss=0.01=.

* <<<Transition metal>>>
A transition metal is an element that has a partially filled
\(d\)-subshell.

These are mostly the elements of the groups (columns) 3 to 11 in the
periodic table, with exceptions.

* <<<Transition metal dichalcogenide>>> (TMD)
Materials of the form \(MX_2\), with \(M\) a transition metal element,
and \(X\) a chalcogen. These are monolayers, where the \(M\) atom
layer is sandwiched between two \(X\) atom layers.

* <<<Zak phase>>>
Berry phase picked up by a particle moving across the unit cell
(i.e. following the first non trivial loop in the torus).
