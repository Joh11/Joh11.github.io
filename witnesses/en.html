	<h1>Speeches</h1>
	<h2>Thibault</h2>
	<p>
	  Dear Arthur, dear Susy,

You asked me—like the other witnesses—to say a few words today. At first, I was of course delighted and honored. Then I thought: “A few words, sure… but in which language?”
Because, honestly, when a Frenchman living in Switzerland marries an Italian who lived in the United States, whom he met in Corsica through an Italian friend he met in Canada while studying in the Netherlands… well, you're not exactly making things easy for the people in charge of “saying a few words.”

And just like that, through this very ordinary question—what language to use today—we immediately grasp the first lesson of your story, and of this marriage: that love, in your case, has no regard for borders. It runs counter to the times we live in.

Once I’d made peace with the fact that I wasn’t going to pretend to speak Italian (I’ll gladly leave that to you, dear Arthur), there was still a second challenge:
What do you say when you're a wedding witness?
Of course, I had tons of ideas, but once I opened my laptop and typed “Arthur and Susy Speech” in bold, I drew a blank.
So, I opened the dictionary and under the letter W (in French, T for témoin), I found:
Witness = “a person who has seen or heard something, and who can, if necessary, attest to it.”

Alright then. What have I seen, what have I heard that might be worth attesting to here today?

What I’ve seen first, is you, Arthur.
A guy straight out of engineering school, one night at a bar in Vancouver—Koerner’s Pub—with a certain Francesco. A funny guy, despite being a tax exile in Switzerland, with a smile as big as his heart, a slight tendency to exaggerate, and at the time, totally obsessed with developing a web app to catalog the clothes in a shop in Lausanne.

That part never changed—there are things I never quite understood: coding, later trail running, chess, blockchain, your mustache. You’ve always had pretty unusual passions for someone who didn’t go to engineering school—but without that, you wouldn’t be you, Arthur.

And then there’s hiking, of course—your passion of all passions. Back then you hiked in a bright yellow Breton raincoat, with a walking stick you’d mischievously named Gregory. That was before Susy—everyone here can measure how far you've come since.
Back then, I never imagined how many hiking memories—and memories in general—we’d end up creating:
Our first bivouac at -3°C, with your flask of whisky in your pocket;
Cornettes de Bise, when you forgot the pasta and breakfast at the checkout;
The Vercors in the rain;
Winter in the Baronnies;
The Mercantour by headlamp.

What I’ve heard is your voice, too.
Your voice speaking English—not so well, at first, let’s admit it—your voice, sometimes loud, with a funny habit of replacing words with others that sound similar.
Your voice during climate protests.
Your voice getting worked up when you talk about ecology and the future—and growing quiet when it searches for a bit of hope.

Your voice, Arthur, that once said to your friends, just like that:
“I’ll always be there for you, no matter what.”

And what I heard years later, was your voice answering your phone at work, one morning when my mind was in a fog. And you found words that helped—simple things like, “Come see me in Lausanne,” but ones that change everything.

You're that kind of rare friend, Arthur. The kind who deserves a medal of honor for all the years spent gathering friends together tirelessly, maintaining strong bonds, building shared experiences, writing a collective story.
Your story, of course—your story together—but a little bit ours, too.

What I’ve seen, after that—or maybe at the same time—was you, Susy.
“After that or at the same time,” I’m not sure anymore, because as luck would have it, I first met you in photos that Francesco sent us from a weekend with you in the Netherlands.
Then in Lyon, and later, I discovered your gentleness, your humor, your joy for life, and your spontaneity—an incredible gift, capable of short-circuiting Arthur the Engineer’s mental machinery from time to time.

Because not everything can be planned or calculated—some things are just to be lived, to be attempted. And that’s a good thing.
Thank you, Susy, for that.

Today I also remember your voice, Arthur, in a bar in New York, so long ago, asking me:
“And you—what do you think about marriage? How do you know when it’s the right person?”
Honestly, I don’t remember what I answered. I don’t even remember what you answered (which is a shame, really, it would’ve made this speech a lot shorter).

But I can testify today that you found the answer yourself.
How did you know she was the one?
Maybe when she was crazy enough to cross the Balkans with you.

And God knows how much courage that takes, Susy—not just to walk 1,200 km, but to spend two months in a tent with Arthur!
I did three days with him in the Vercors, and I couldn’t look at an SUV for six months without wanting to slash its tires.

You know it's the right one when you share simple things that give life its flavor and depth:
Friendship.
Hospitality.
Care for others and for our environment.
Warmth.
Big-eared cats.
Blockchain—well, no, thank God, Susy, you’re not one of those people.
The mountains, of course. The mountains that lift the soul, sharpen the mind and the legs—the mountains that gave you the encounter of a lifetime.

And the wonderful thing about mountains is that they don’t move.
They’ll still be there for you—
Because there will be many passes to cross together.
Marriage is not an easy hike: there will be elevation, sometimes uphill, sometimes down.
The route won’t always be clearly marked—but that’s what makes for the best hikes.

And honestly, looking at how beautiful you both are today,
there’s no pass too high, no trail too steep for your strides.

So today, dear Arthur, dear Susy,
as a witness—as someone who has seen or heard something and can, if necessary, attest to it—
I will attest that I’ve seen all this, and more.

I’ve seen in you the hope of a future softer than Yoda’s fur.
I’ve seen the promise of love as an act of resistance.
Love beyond borders.
Love for the other—for what is not you, does not speak your language,
but still has a heart that beats.

So thank you for all of that.
I wish you nothing but happiness, both of you,
“so that joy may burst forth each hour and every day,” as Jacques Brel said,
	  “and that you may live your promises with no greater wealth than always believing in them.”
	  
	<h2>Abigail</h2>
	<p>Ciao a tutti. <br/><br/>
Susy and I happened to meet in a photography class. We were in a high school in South Dakota — the middle of nowhere, USA. When we first met, I never imagined that 10 years later, I would be giving a speech at her wedding. <br/><br/>
My dear Susy Q, the photography classroom was where our friendship first developed - like a photograph coming to life in the darkroom. From our first hangout at Pita Pit, to jamming out to the Avett Brothers in my family’s huge suburban, to exploring the Black Hills, we grew closer together with every photograph snapped and memory shared.<br/><br/>
Photography quickly became one of the themes of our friendship. After Susy left the US, we sent each other photo after photo. Life updates, silly selfies, you name it. And, when we finally reunited a year later, we captured memory after memory — our reunion at the airport in Milano, the first-ever recording of our debut single, “Yellow Jello”, our road trip in a borrowed little red car, our adventures to Australia and New Zealand and beyond. Yes, we captured historic places and scenic landscapes, but we also captured our friendship as it grew even deeper. <br/><br/>
It was after the return from our gap year that Susy first met Arthur. She messaged me on WhatsApp to tell me that she had met a boy. She said, and I quote, “I’m not sure what will happen. But, I really like the way he looks at me. With his eyes, it’s like he really sees all of me.”
When Susy sent a picture of her and Arthur together a few days later, I saw exactly what she meant by this. I could tell that Arthur saw what I did in Susy - a beautiful, amazing woman who is not only smart and kind and strong and multilingual, but also someone who possesses a certain, lovely light that radiates from within to embrace everyone and everything she encounters. <br/><br/>
Arthur, before we met on our ski trip a year later, I was nervous. For several reasons — mainly because I couldn’t pronounce your name right. After trying to google a pronunciation guide, I accidentally discovered the meaning behind your name as well. According to some, “Arthur” might be derived from an old word meaning “bear”. And, after meeting you, I know this fits. You are a bear — you are passionate, strong, and most comfortable when trekking through the outdoors. You truly care about the things and people most important to you, especially Susy. And I have grown to see a similar light in you, even though I still can’t pronounce your name right!
For the past six years, I have watched Susy and Arthur grow their relationship through pictures and stories from afar. From moving in together, to completing more mountain treks, to becoming Yoda’s parents. With each peak and valley crossed, you have added another brick to the foundation of your “unit”. You balance each other well — knowing when to give and when to take, when to cry and when to laugh, when to push through, and when to rest. <br/>
Today, dear Arthur and Susy Q, I am proud to witness your love and commitment to each other as it grows and blossoms further every day. We are incredibly lucky to be recording more memories and taking more photos “for the books”. And I am beyond honored to witness your marriage. So, here’s to a lifetime of love, friendship, good fortune, and shared happiness. 
I love you both. Buona fortuna e auguri! <br/><br/>

	</p>
	<h2>Johan</h2>
	<p>
	  Hello everyone. My name is Johan, and I am Arthur’s best man, his best friend. <br/>

A few words about how I met Arthur: the first time was quite a while ago, in our second year, during a humanities class, where I found him quite unbearable. But that prejudice didn’t stop us from seeing each other again later in Vancouver, where, late one evening over a glass of white wine, we made a promise to go hiking together once back in Switzerland. A promise we kept—there have been countless weekends in tents, in cabins, on foot, on skis, by bike. <br/>

Arthur’s greatest quality? Without a doubt, it’s his enthusiasm. It’s what pushed me to do so many things with him, and it’s what allowed him to gather a large group of close friends, whom I’m delighted to see all here today. <br/>

As for Susy: to me, she was at first a discreet presence, “the sister of,” and quite quickly after that, “the girlfriend of.” But over time we got to know each other, through dinners, camping trips, evenings at Chavan. I discovered someone passionate about so many things—mountains, of course, but also creative arts, cooking, reading. I discovered someone with a great sense of hospitality and openness, offering a beautiful counterbalance to Arthur’s sometimes single-minded dynamism. And someone with resilience too, a kind of steadiness that commands respect. <br/>

Today, at this beautiful ceremony, in such an idyllic setting, I bear the weighty task of testifying to their love—love that has a past, but also a future. <br/>

First, the past: if you ask me for proof of Arthur’s love for Susy, a few moments come immediately to mind. <br/>

First, shortly before the pandemic lockdown, at the climbing gym with Lorenzo, when Arthur, with distress in his voice, found out the borders with Italy were closing, and that Susy wouldn’t be able to come see him, that they would be separated for long and painful months. <br/>

Another unforgettable moment came a few months later. The borders were still closed, but Arthur was determined: he would go to Italy to be with her. I drove him to the Grand Saint Bernard Pass, and I’ll never forget the sight of Arthur, loaded like a traveling salesman, walking alone, negotiating with the lone border guard, and then disappearing into the mist on the other side, where Susy was waiting for him. I can only imagine how joyful that reunion must have been. <br/>

Final proof: their crossing of the Dinaric Alps on foot—several months of living with each other non-stop. The ultimate test of their relationship, and one they passed, since they said “yes” to each other at the top of a mountain pass in Albania, as their journey was coming to an end. <br/>

Arthur and Susy’s story began on the GR20, the trail that crosses Corsica from north to south. A highly symbolic encounter: the Frenchman, the Italian—two cultures, close neighbors, but separated by a millennium of linguistic divergence, and more importantly, by the Alps, hundreds of kilometers of sharp ridgelines. A nearly impassable wall—unless you go around it, say, through the south, in Corsica, where borders start to blur and the impossible becomes possible. <br/>

Let’s take this mountain metaphor a bit further. Through the stories I’ve told you and the previous speeches, another idea emerges: that of the mountain pass. A pass is a break in the wall, the only spot where passage is possible. Let’s be realistic: I can’t wish you a long life together without trials or hardships. But I can wish you something else. That whenever you face a mountain that seems insurmountable, you find a pass. That you climb it together, to help you move forward—united—but also to rise above. And in return, there will surely be a magnificent view at the top. <br/>
	  
	  <h2>Francesco</h2>
	<p></p>

	  <h2>Arthur</h2>
	<p>Susanne, how can I put into words everything you mean to me? Maybe by starting where it all began. <br/>

It was seven years ago, in Vancouver. I met a tall, cheerful guy, full of energy — sometimes even louder than me. Would you have believed it, Francesco, that we would become like brothers? <br/>

The first collision with your existence, Susy, was one evening in December 2018. Francesco showed us a photo of you, and we all laughed when Thibault jokingly told him not to introduce you to me. Luckily for me, he didn’t follow that advice. Six months later, he invited me to hike across Corsica on the GR20. He had promised I would meet his sister there. <br/>

Francesco, you had just given me, without knowing it, the most beautiful encounter of my life. <br/>

It was July 6, 2019, right here in Liguria. I remember arriving, your long red dress, our swim in the harbor. You made such an impression on me! That very night, I called my mother and told her: “Mom, I’ve met the most beautiful woman in the world.” <br/>

I thought I was heading out for a few days of hiking — without knowing it, I was stepping into the greatest adventure of my life. I was overwhelmed by the clarity of our connection. Two months later, I made my first round trip to the Netherlands. <br/>

Over the years, we’ve made so many dreams come true — travels, nights in tents, countless kilometers shared. It hasn’t always been easy: years of long-distance, health issues, postponed moves… And at every stage, I discovered in you a strength that still amazes me. You’ve taught me patience, trust, and the beauty of moving forward together. Our unity makes us stronger. <br/>

All those adventures led us to that morning, a year ago, July 7, 2024, in our tent in Albania. While you were still sleeping a little, I was struggling to shape an engagement ring out of a little Decathlon string. And how happy you were with that string! <br/>

That morning, I felt the deepest kind of gratitude: for having found the strongest of companions. For being surrounded by your gentleness, your kindness, your joy for life. And for having learned by your side how to keep alive the promise of our love. <br/>

Since we’re speaking of promises, may I now make you mine — in front of everyone we love. <br/>

I promise to be there to laugh by your side — because nothing is more beautiful than your laughter — and to dry your tears when needed. <br/>

I promise to celebrate every one of your achievements, because I know there will be many. <br/>

I promise to share every step, every detour, every river to cross, even if it means sleepless nights with Yoda or evicting hornets from your bun. <br/>

I promise to cherish every one of our adventures, and to nurture that thirst for exploration that has united us for six years. <br/>

I promise to cultivate our independence — that precious quality that allows us to come back to each other even stronger after every time apart. <br/>

And finally, the most important promise: I promise to dedicate my body, my soul, and all my strength to the universe we dream of building. One of a French-Italian — maybe even Swiss — family, carried by hope, dreams, and travel. A family rooted in unconditional love, in a world often shaken by doubt. <br/>

Speaking of hope: everyone here knows how hard it can be to keep it alive. I, too, often doubt — and I’m sorry if I tell you that too much. <br/>

But you, Susanne, you embody it every day. Thank you for your joy for life, your boundless energy, your gaze that finds beauty in the smallest things — like that Decathlon string in Albania. You’re the one who gives me the strength to keep believing, and to keep moving forward in our values. <br/>

How proud I am of us. And how deeply I love you, Susanne. <br/></p>

	<h2>Susanne</h2>
	<p>
	  Arthur,<br/>

I remember the day up in Northern Albania, when you asked me to marry you.<br/>

A mountain pass that looked a little bit like this one, actually, exactly like this one!!<br/>

You had walked up ahead and were waiting for me at the top. <br/>

And then you asked, like, 3 times, because I wasn’t sure of what you’d said.<br/>

And I said you know, you are not just marrying me, but also all my problems.<br/>

In sickness and in health, let’s say there’s been lots of sickness.<br/>

But you, you were all in, you always have been, from the very start.<br/>



When I met you I wasn’t looking for you. But there you were. <br/>

And I found myself, day after day, pulled towards you, <br/>

As if an invisible string connected us and got shorter and shorter <br/>

With each glance, each thought shared.<br/>

Little did I know that the hint of disappointment I would feel <br/>

Each time we didn’t end up in the same tent at night <br/>

Would turn into this moment, into sharing our life and who we are with all the people who we love the most.<br/><br/>



I hope they all see today just how bright you shine.<br/>

You are spontaneous you are messy you are loud you are real.<br/>

If anything just a tiiiiiny bit stressed, but<br/>

You are a man of great sensibility, and with a soul of such depth and complexity<br/>

That I feel in 6 years I’ve barely scratched the surface.<br/>

You do not care to step away from the crowd, <br/>

And yet you care so deeply, about so many things.<br/>

I love this about you, you keep be curious, engaged with the world.<br/>

I love that mischievous smile and that look in your eyes<br/>

When you have done something bad and are waiting for me to find out.<br/>

Like the one time you put curry in my coffee,<br/>

Or when you shaved your mustache after five years<br/>

And I didn’t notice.<br/>

You are so playful then, like a child.<br/>

And with you I can be a child again.<br/>

You have many faces, and I’ll take them all.<br/>


Not long ago you told me you are scared of settling and losing our adventures.<br/>

Grow older, set into habits.<br/>

It was so easy for me to dismiss your worries.<br/>

I am not scared to settle, if it is with you.<br/>

Because I know that a life with you does not equal settling.<br/>

A life with you is the greatest adventure of them all.<br/>

It is a not a breeze, but a great storm,<br/>

Intense, trying at times, exhilarating.<br/>

A life of exploring, of laughing in the bathroom at night, <br/>

Of fighting and finding our way back to each other.<br/>

Of dancing the silliest dances when we both don’t dance, <br/>

Of sleeping in the tent in our own garden.<br/><br/>



Our unit, has gone thru so much<br/>

One until, where two halves choose to sacrifice part of their independence, <br/>

to make space for the other’s hopes and dreams<br/>

Sacrifice is often seen as something negative, but to sacrifice is to make sacred<br/>

This space that we make is sacred, and in it something bigger than us can find its roots and grow<br/>

And at any point can one half leave the unit and go about his or her life, <br/>

and she will have a great time too, but she will always know that she belongs, <br/>

And that there’s a space for her that is kept warm and safe. <br/>



I am so proud of us. So many times I’ve felt this deep sense of euphoria and pride<br/>

For what we chose and what we’ve accomplished and who we’ve become.<br/>

We will never lose this, and we will pass it on.<br/>

If you still need proof, just remember that even after five years <br/>

You still needed me to walk 1200 km through rocks and bushes <br/>

To really make sure I was the one. <br/>



With the rest of our lives ahead, <br/>

I promise to take your hand and walk together.<br/>

Let us continue <br/>

To sing many trails <br/>

And hike many songs.<br/>

And I wish for us to not be afraid to do what our hearts desire.<br/>

Let’s be loud.<br/>

Let’s shout it from the roof for the whole world to hear.<br/>

I love you. <br/>
