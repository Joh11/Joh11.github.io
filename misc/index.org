#+title: Misc pages

A collection of stuff.

- [[file:bz.org][Brillouin zone visualization]]: a WebGL app to visualize the Brillouin
  zone for a given lattice, and play with it interactively
- [[file:graphene.org][Graphene and Haldane model band structure]]: a WebGL app to visualize
  the band structure of graphene. The Hamiltonian parameters can be
  tweaked, especially one can add a Haldane term, to see how it breaks
  the symmetries of the band structure.
